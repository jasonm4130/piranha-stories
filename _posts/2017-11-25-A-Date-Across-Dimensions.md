title: A Date Across Dimensions
---

I jiggled my legs nervously, then straightened my bowtie. I knew I shouldn’t have worn it, but it was too late to do anything about it. I’d look stupid if she arrived now, and I was fiddling with it. Stay calm, I told myself. Deep breaths. 

My heart raced when I thought about her. Kasey was cute in a dorky kind of way that worked for me. She had short, shiny brown hair that she kept tucked behind her ear in all the photos I had seen. Her eyes were brown, a rich tone that reminded me of smooth milk chocolate. She had a spray of freckles across her nose, and when she smiled, small dimples appeared in both cheeks.

I thought she was the most amazing person ever. The only problem was that we had never met in person. 

We met online, and I was hooked from our first chat. We liked all the same things. Star Wars. Harry Potter. She loved Doctor Who, especially the episodes with Matt Smith. That’s why I had worn the bowtie, trying to impress her. Now I was worried I had over done it. 

‘Can I take your order?’ The waitress at the café asked. She was your typically pretty blonde, but I barely noticed. I only had eyes for one girl. 

‘No thanks, I’m waiting for someone.’ I said. 

The waitress raised her eyebrows, then stalked off. I guess it had been a while, and she was getting impatient. So was I. Kasey and I had agreed to meet up almost half an hour ago. I decided I would text Kasey, just to see where she was.

Kasey responded immediately. 

*I’m already here. Where are you?* 

I glanced around the café. I couldn’t see her anywhere. None of the girls looked remotely like the Kasey I had seen online. I swallowed, my mouth feeling dry. Maybe I had been cat fished, and Kasey didn’t look anything like her photos. I remembered she had told me she was going to wear a shirt with a Tardis on it. None of the people in the café wore anything remotely Dr. Who themed. 

*I’m here too. I can’t see you.* I texted back. *Describe what’s around you.* 

*I’m at the table with the purple watering can.*

I looked around. Each table had a watering can on the top, painted a different color. Mine was the only one painted purple. I laughed. Kasey must be hiding just to tease me. 

*Come on out Kasey. I know you can see me.* I responded. 

*No really, I’m just sitting at the table. Look, I’m going to do something really silly, so you’d better come over once. I’m going to hold the salt shaker above my head.* 

As soon as I read that message, something strange happened. The salt shaker, which was just sitting in the middle of the table a moment ago was picked up by an invisible hand and brought rest over the chair, roughly the place it would be if someone had picked it up to hold it above their head. 

I would like to say that I kept my cool, but I definitely didn’t. I let out a yelp, drawing some strange looks from people around me. The salt shaker was lowered to the table once more. 

*Kasey, I could see the salt shaker, but I couldn’t see you. I want to try something. Now I’m going to hold the salt shaker above my head.*

Then, feeling like a bit of a fool, I raised the shaker above my head. Suddenly it was grabbed out of my hand, and fell to the table, salt spilling everywhere. 

*Jay, what’s happening? I could see it too, it was floating in the air. I tried to grab it and I felt some resistance.*

My mind swam. It seemed so bizarre, I couldn’t make any sense of it. 

*I’m lifting a knife off the table. Can you see it?* I texted back. 

*No.* 

I swept some salt around the table absently, trying to make sense of it. My phone received another text from Kasey.

*The salt just moved!*

A lightbulb in my brain flicked on. I had watched so many sci fi television shows, many of them about alternate dimensions. Only one explanation fit. Kasey and I did not belong to the same dimension. Somehow our worlds had collided online. We were at the same café, but we couldn’t see each other. The only link between us was the salt that had spilled from the shaker. 

I took up the fallen shaker, and spread it out, making a thick layer. Then I wrote one word. 

*Kasey.*

I saw the word being erased and an invisible finger was pulled through it.

*Jay, I’m scared.*

Reading that, my heart leapt into my throat. I erased it quickly, and wrote:

*Don’t worry Kasey. I’ll find you.*
