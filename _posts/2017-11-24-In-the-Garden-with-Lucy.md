title: In the Garden with Lucy
---

‘Mum, I’m doing it already!’ Lucy called out over her shoulder. She held the trash at arm’s length, pointing her nose firmly in the opposite direction. She walked down the hallway to the back door. Opening it with one hand, she slid outside. 

Lucy’s grandparents lived in a quaint little college on the outskirts of the city. Although the backyard was average sized, it was beautiful. The garden was bursting with colors from exotic looking flowers all year round. It was also teeming with life – birds, butterflies and other insects flitted by. They had a water feature in the center, a stone mermaid with hair all the way down her back perched on a stone in the middle of a basin. The basin was full of fish, and Lucy loved to watch as they swam through the clear water. 

Lucy dumped the trashed in a large bin out back, then stooped to wash her hands under the tap jutting from the wall. As she bent over, she saw a spider had spun its web between the spout, and the wall. 

Lucy frowned. Caught in the spider web was a butterfly. It was the prettiest butterfly she had seen, with delicate wings that were a deep royal blue. It may have been a trick of the light, but its wings looked like they were tipped with gold. It was clearly struggling frantically, to no avail. It was hopelessly stuck.

Shuddering slightly, Lucy looked at the web more carefully. She couldn’t see a spider anywhere near. She was terrified of spiders. Satisfied there weren’t any near, she grabbed a twig from the nearest bush and broke the spiders web, being careful not to squash the butterfly. Finally, it broke free. 

Lucy breathed a sigh of relief. She couldn’t think of anything worse than being stuck to a spider’s web, knowing that at any moment it could come back and eat you.

‘There you go, you’re free now.’ She said to the butterfly. 

After a few loops in the air, the butterfly hovered close to Lucy’s face. Lucy raised her hand. To her amazement, the butterfly landed on her outstretched index finger. She had tried many times to catch butterflies in the yard, or have them land on her. This was the first time that they had shown any interest in her whatsoever. 

‘I’m glad I found you. Being eaten by a spider would be a terrible way to go.’ She said to the butterfly balanced on her finger. Then she sighed. ‘I wish I knew your name. I’m sure butterflies have names, just like people.’

‘My name is Alexander.’ She heard a voice say. It didn’t seem to come from any direction, but was spoken directly into her mind. ‘And I guess I owe you my thanks. You saved my life.’ 
Lucy’s jaw dropped. Could it be the butterfly was talking to her? Looking closer she noticed something strange. The butterfly was wearing a golden crown. And it wasn’t a butterfly with a black body like she had seen a few moments earlier. It was a small boy, with wings. He was wearing a blue tunic to match them, and black leggings. 

‘What is your name?’

‘L-l-lucy.’ She stammered. Then, worrying she was being rude she added ‘I’m pleased to meet you.’
‘The pleasure is all mine Lucy. For your kindness I would like to take you into the Oasis, so I could bestow upon you an appropriate reward. Would you like to come?’ 

‘Uh… sure?’ She replied.

‘Then close your eyes.’ The butterfly took flight, then landed on the ground near her left sneaker. Obediently Lucy shut her eyes tight. Suddenly she felt like she was spinning around faster and faster like a spinning top. A few seconds passed, and the motion stopped. 

‘You can open your eyes now.’ 

When Lucy opened her eyes, she squealed. She was surrounded by a giant green wall. To her left stood the boy. He smiled at her, and held out his hand. It took her a moment to realize she was now the size of a butterfly.
